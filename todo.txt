* In run_test.sh
  - Test more labels (in addition to  iris3_name)
  - Test the copying of project labels.
* Test CloudSQL automatically (difficult because it takes 10 minutes to initialize)
* PubSub push endpoint security:
  Note: This token is not very secure, though it is an improvement on earlier versions of Iris,
  and Google has at times recommended it.
  - Could replace the PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN with random value in deploy.sh
  - Using JWT is better: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push
* Use Cloud Tasks instead of PubSub to trigger label_one. This will allow a delay of ~10 minutes, which should
  allow the labeling on creation of Cloud SQL Instances, and maybe boot disks created with VM instances.
* Address the error "Labels fingerprint either invalid or resource labels have changed", printed in _batch_callback,
  which is intermittent and found most often with disks.
    Solutions:
      - Retry
      - Ignore and let the cron do it
* The need for title case--only the first character capitalized--is clumsy for Bigtable and Cloudsql. Rethink that.
