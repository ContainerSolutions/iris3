# TODO In run_test.sh, test more labels (other than iris3_name); and test the copying of project labels.
# TODO Test CloudSQL automatically (difficult because it takes 10 minutes to initialize)
# TODO PubSub push endpoint security:
#   Note: This token is not very secure, though it is an improvement on earlier versions of Iris,
#   and Google has at times recommended it.
#   You could replace the PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN with random value in deploy.sh
#   Using JWT is better: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push
# TODO Address the error "Labels fingerprint either invalid or resource labels have changed", printed in _batch_callback,
# which is intermittent and found most often with disks.
# Solutions:
#  - Retry
#  - Ignore and let the cron do it
