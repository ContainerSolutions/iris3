#TODO BigTable and CloudSQL in run_test.sh
#TODO Test more labels (Other than iris3_name) in run_test.sh
#TODO Test the copying of project labels in run_test.sh
# TODO eliminate the labels configuration in config.yaml and instead just read all methods starting with _get_
# TODO Instead of _get_ as the magic prefix, use _gcp_ (because _get_ methods are  too easy to mistake for ordinary getters and then delete or alter them)
# TODO Use IAM-based pubsub security instead of pubsub_token
# TODO Address this error, printed in _batch_callback, which is intermittent and found most often with disks.
#  "Labels fingerprint either invalid or resource labels have changed".
#  - Perhaps retry
#  - Perhaps ignore and let the cron get it
